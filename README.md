Home-grown encryption project for educational purposes - all cryptographic algorithms were implemented from scratch (with the exception of primitives such as crypto_bigint)

Includes a UI that allows two parties to communicate over a shared channel - first a shared key is derived using ElGamal assymetric encryption, and all subsequent communication is done using 256-bit Twofish with SHA-256-HMAC for authentication.

You should decide in advance which side is Alice and which is Bob, though this is completely arbitrary.
